# Data handling and leakage-safe preprocessing

Verified for scikit-survival 0.28.0 on 2026-07-23.

## Standard right-censored outcome

scikit-survival estimators expect a one-dimensional NumPy structured array with
exactly two fields:

1. a boolean event indicator (`True`=event observed, `False`=right-censored);
2. a floating-point observed time (event or censoring time).

Field names are configurable, but field order and meaning are fixed.

```python
from sksurv.util import Surv

y = Surv.from_arrays(
    event=[True, False, True],
    time=[2.5, 4.0, 7.25],
    name_event="event",
    name_time="time",
)
assert y.dtype.names == ("event", "time")
```

`Surv.from_arrays()` accepts boolean or strict 0/1 event values.
`Surv.from_dataframe(event, time, data)` accepts pandas and, in 0.28, Polars
DataFrames:

```python
y = Surv.from_dataframe("event", "time", frame)
```

Do not use `astype(bool)` on unvalidated strings: `"False"` is a non-empty string
and therefore converts to `True`. Validate accepted values explicitly.

## Competing-risk outcome is different

`Surv` is not the input contract for nonparametric competing-risk cumulative
incidence. Use two arrays:

```python
# 0 = right-censored; 1..K = mutually exclusive causes
event_code = frame["status"].to_numpy(dtype=int)
observed_time = frame["time"].to_numpy(dtype=float)
```

Positive cause codes must be understood before modeling. Do not collapse them to
boolean until the estimand explicitly requires all-cause event status or a
cause-specific hazard outcome. See `competing-risks.md`.

## Minimum validation

Before splitting:

- event and time lengths match feature rows;
- standard event values are boolean/0/1;
- competing-risk codes are non-negative integers and 0 means censoring;
- time is numeric, finite, and strictly positive;
- outcomes are not included among predictors;
- feature names are unique and schema roles are explicit;
- repeated entities, temporal ordering, or sites are identified for the split;
- every planned training/CV fold contains events and censored observations;
- missingness is described, but imputation is not yet fitted.

The bundled validator performs these checks on bounded local CSV input:

```bash
python skills/scikit-survival/scripts/validate_survival_csv.py \
  --input data.csv \
  --event-column event \
  --time-column time \
  --feature-columns x1,x2,group \
  --structured-output outcome.npy
```

The `.npy` file contains a non-object structured array and can be loaded with
`numpy.load(path, allow_pickle=False)`.

## Split before learned preprocessing

This order is mandatory:

1. validate types and outcome coding;
2. split rows;
3. fit imputation, encoding, scaling, and feature selection on training rows;
4. transform validation/test rows with training-fitted state;
5. fit the survival estimator;
6. evaluate once on the held-out rows.

Computing medians, category levels, scaling moments, univariate scores, or
regularization paths on all rows leaks validation/test information.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.25,
    stratify=y["event"],
    random_state=20260723,
)
```

Event stratification does not guarantee balanced follow-up times. Inspect each
split. Use group-aware splitting for repeated entities and time-respecting
splitting for future-deployment questions. A random split is not automatically
appropriate.

## Explicit heterogeneous pipeline

Use scikit-learn's `ColumnTransformer` when numeric and categorical columns need
different imputers or when unseen categories must be handled explicitly.

```python
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
from sksurv.linear_model import CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis

numeric_pipe = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="median"),
    StandardScaler(),
)
categorical_pipe = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent"),
    OneHotEncoder(
        handle_unknown="ignore",
        drop="first",
        sparse_output=False,
    ),
)
preprocess = ColumnTransformer(
    [
        ("numeric", numeric_pipe, numeric_columns),
        ("categorical", categorical_pipe, categorical_columns),
    ],
    sparse_threshold=0.0,
)
pipeline = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis(alpha=0.1, ties="efron"),
)
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Keep the estimator in the same pipeline used by cross-validation so each fold
fits its own preprocessing state.

### scikit-survival encoder

`sksurv.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder(allow_drop=True)`:

- treats pandas `category`/`object` and Polars categorical/enum/string columns as
  categorical;
- leaves non-categorical column order in place;
- drops one category per categorical feature;
- returns the same DataFrame library as its input;
- requires `fit` and `transform` to use the same DataFrame library;
- supports `get_feature_names_out()` and pipeline use.

It is convenient for already clean DataFrames:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sksurv.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

pipeline = make_pipeline(
    OneHotEncoder(),
    CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis(alpha=0.1),
)
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

For custom files, an explicit `ColumnTransformer` usually makes missing-value,
unknown-category, and scaling behavior easier to audit.

`encode_categorical()` is a one-shot transformation, not a fitted train/test
transformer. Do not call it separately on all data or independently on train and
test when category sets can differ.

## Scaling and missing values

- Scale Coxnet, survival SVM, IPC ridge, and other coefficient/penalty models.
- Tree ensembles generally do not require scaling.
- Impute inside the pipeline unless the selected estimator explicitly supports the
  observed missing-value pattern.
- SurvivalTree, RandomSurvivalForest, and ExtraSurvivalTrees support missing-value
  splitting in current releases, but preprocessing may still be needed for
  categorical data and operational consistency.
- Never impute event indicators or event/censoring times as ordinary features.

Missingness can be informative. A convenient imputer does not justify a
missing-at-random assumption or transportability claim.

## Feature selection

Feature selection is learned preprocessing and belongs inside inner CV:

```python
pipeline = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    selector,
    estimator,
)
```

Do not use a standard classification `SelectKBest` score with structured survival
outcomes unless the score function explicitly supports censoring. Coxnet or
componentwise boosting can perform embedded selection, but regularization strength
still requires fold-contained tuning.

Fixed "events per variable" thresholds are not universal guarantees. Consider
effective degrees of freedom, censoring, shrinkage, separation, stability, and
external validation instead of declaring a model valid from one ratio.

## Built-in datasets

Current loaders:

- `load_aids(endpoint=...)`
- `load_bmt()`
- `load_cgvhd()`
- `load_breast_cancer()`
- `load_flchain()`
- `load_gbsg2()`
- `load_whas500()`
- `load_veterans_lung_cancer()`
- `load_arff_files_standardized(...)`

`load_bmt()` returns event codes 0, 1, 2 and `load_cgvhd()` returns 0, 1, 2, 3;
these are competing-risk outcomes. The remaining listed study loaders return the
standard boolean right-censored outcome (subject to endpoint options).

These packaged datasets are useful for reproducing documentation, but they are
real study datasets. The bundled CLIs and tests do not use them; they use synthetic
data only. Do not treat examples as clinical advice or a substitute for data-use
review.

In 0.28, dataset loaders accept an `output_type` option where documented, allowing
pandas (default) or Polars feature output.

## Unsupported or specialized structures

Standard estimators do not directly encode:

- interval-censored outcomes;
- ordinary left-censoring;
- time-varying covariates in counting-process form;
- recurrent-event dependence;
- multi-state transitions;
- delayed entry in the two-field `Surv` estimator outcome.

Some nonparametric APIs expose entry-time arguments, but that does not make every
estimator support left truncation. Choose a method whose likelihood and input
contract match the observation process.

## Local-data safeguards

- Use only authorized, appropriately de-identified local data.
- Do not put row-level data in logs or model reports.
- Do not load untrusted pickle/joblib model files.
- Keep feature and row bounds proportionate to available resources.
- Use descriptive script names; never create files named after packages such as
  `sklearn.py` or `sksurv.py`.
