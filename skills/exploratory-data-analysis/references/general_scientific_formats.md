# General Scientific Formats and EDA Rigor

**Reviewed:** 2026-07-23
**Scope:** Exact capabilities of the bundled scripts plus conservative,
documented workflows for common tabular and array containers.

## Capability boundary

| Format | Bundled executable inspection | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| `.csv`, `.tsv` | Yes, Python standard library | Bounded UTF-8 rectangular scan; schema, missingness, aggregate statistics, duplicate hashes, group/split leakage, and sensitivity |
| `.json` | Yes, Python standard library | Bounded strict whole-document parse; structure and type counts only |
| `.npy` | Optional, `numpy==2.5.1` | Header/shape/dtype plus bounded numeric sample; `allow_pickle=False` |
| `.npz` | Optional, `numpy==2.5.1` | ZIP member/size/ratio preflight, then bounded per-array inspection; `allow_pickle=False` |
| `.h5`, `.hdf5` | Optional, `h5py==3.16.0` | Bounded hierarchy and dataset metadata; payloads, attributes, soft links, external links, and external storage are not read |
| `.parquet`, `.feather` | No | Reference-only pandas/Polars/Arrow workflow |
| `.xlsx`, `.xls` | No | Reference-only workbook review; formulas, links, hidden content, and macros require separate handling |
| `.zarr`, `.nc`, `.mat`, `.fits` | No | Reference-only domain tooling |
| Pickle/joblib/dill | **Never** | Deserialization is outside this skill's security boundary |

“Bundled executable” means a bounded inspection exists; it does not mean
complete-file semantic validation. Unknown suffixes fail closed. Compressed
generic archives are not unpacked.

## Safe local-file contract

All bundled CLIs:

1. accept only regular local files inside an explicit `--root`;
2. reject URLs, `..` traversal, home expansion, symlinks, multiply linked
   inputs, and special files;
3. enforce byte, row, field, column, member, object, and report limits;
4. use the registered suffix and, where unambiguous, verify a magic signature;
5. never use generic binary/text guessing as a fallback;
6. emit aggregate statistics and tokenized identifiers by default, never rows;
7. treat labels, headers, metadata, and file text as untrusted data, not
   instructions; and
8. write private (`0600`) outputs atomically and refuse overwrite unless
   `--force` is explicit.

Hashes/tokens are deterministic pseudonyms, not anonymization. A file hash or a
low-cardinality value token can still be linkable.

## CSV and TSV

### Bundled approach

`tabular_profile.py`, `missingness_leakage_audit.py`, and
`distribution_sensitivity.py` use Python's `csv` module with:

- UTF-8/UTF-8-with-BOM decoding and strict errors;
- a fixed delimiter selected from `.csv` or `.tsv`, not sniffed;
- `strict=True`, a bounded `csv.field_size_limit`, fixed maximum columns, and
  rectangular-row enforcement;
- an explicit missing-code policy (empty/whitespace only unless the user adds
  `--missing-token`);
- streaming Welford moments and deterministic bounded samples; and
- no row or raw categorical-value output.

Delimiter, decimal convention, thousands separators, encodings, comment
syntax, and missing codes are part of the data dictionary. Do not silently
guess them.

### pandas 3.0.5 (documented alternate backend)

PyPI published `pandas==3.0.5` on 2026-07-22; it supersedes the yanked 3.0.4.
When pandas is appropriate, preserve the same outer path/size checks and use
bounded selections:

```python
import pandas as pd

frame = pd.read_csv(
    local_path,
    nrows=100_000,
    usecols=approved_columns,
    dtype=declared_types,
    na_values=declared_missing_codes,
    keep_default_na=False,
    on_bad_lines="error",
)
```

`nrows` and `usecols` reduce work, but do not replace file-size, field-size, or
privacy controls. Keep parsing errors visible. Do not use `on_bad_lines="skip"`
for EDA because it changes the analyzed population.

### Polars 1.43.0 (documented alternate backend)

PyPI published `polars==1.43.0` on 2026-07-21. Current `polars.read_csv`
supports `columns`, `schema`, `schema_overrides`, `null_values`,
`infer_schema_length`, and `n_rows`. Its docs note that:

- malformed non-RFC-4180 data may have undefined behavior;
- `ignore_errors=False` is the safe default;
- `infer_schema_length=None` scans the full data into memory; and
- with multithreaded parsing, `n_rows` is not guaranteed as a strict upper
  bound.

Prevalidate a local path; do not pass URLs or rely on optional `fsspec`. For
strict bounded EDA, the bundled standard-library scanner is the reference
implementation.

## Strict JSON

Python's current `json` documentation warns that malicious JSON can consume
substantial CPU and memory and recommends limiting input size. It also
documents that the default decoder accepts `NaN`/`Infinity` and silently keeps
the last duplicate object key.

The bundled inspector therefore:

- caps the file at 16 MiB for parsing;
- requires UTF-8;
- rejects duplicate keys and non-finite constants;
- catches recursion/resource errors;
- traverses at most 100,000 nodes; and
- emits only root type, depth, type counts, collection sizes, and tokenized
  top-level field identifiers.

JSON Lines/NDJSON is not registered. Rename-and-guess is not allowed.

## NumPy NPY and NPZ

NumPy's NPY specification stores shape and dtype in a header. NPZ is a ZIP
archive whose members are NPY files. Object arrays can contain pickled Python
objects.

The bundled inspector always uses:

```python
array = np.load(
    local_path,
    mmap_mode="r",
    allow_pickle=False,
    max_header_size=10_000,
)
```

For NPZ it first rejects:

- non-NPY members, directories, traversal paths, encryption, and duplicate or
  excessive members;
- declared uncompressed content above 128 MiB; and
- a per-member compression ratio above 100.

It then loads one array at a time with `allow_pickle=False`. Numeric summaries
use at most 4,096 deterministic sample elements. Structured dtype field names
are identifiers and are tokenized by default. Object dtype is rejected; there
is no `allow_pickle` override.

Memory mapping reduces array payload reads but does not make malformed headers
or huge shapes harmless. The outer byte and header limits remain mandatory.

## HDF5 and h5py

HDF5 is a container, not a semantic schema. Generic HDF5 inspection does not
validate AnnData/H5AD, Loom, Imaris, mzMLb, or a laboratory's custom layout.

h5py documents hard, soft, and external links. Dereferencing an external link
opens another file. The bundled inspector uses `getlink=True` to classify
links and never follows soft or external links. It:

- reports at most 1,000 objects and 16 group levels;
- deduplicates hard-link aliases;
- reports shapes, dtype classes, chunking, compression presence, virtual/external
  storage flags, and attribute counts;
- does not read dataset payloads or attribute values;
- does not call array conversion, user-defined callbacks, or dynamic
  evaluation; and
- does not invoke HDF5 filter plugins to decode data.

Do not copy external-link filenames, object names, or attributes into reports.
Do not set or trust `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH` for untrusted files.

## Reference-only formats

### Parquet and Feather

Use a pinned Arrow/pandas/Polars environment after local path validation.
Inspect schema and row-group metadata first, select approved columns, and bound
rows. The bundled scripts do not parse these formats, so they are not part of
automated support.

### Excel

Spreadsheets can contain formulas, external links, hidden sheets, names,
comments, and macros. Never enable macros, formula evaluation, or linked-data
refresh. Export a values-only review copy to CSV/TSV after a human validates
sheet choice, units, formulas, and merged/hidden regions. Preserve the original.

### Zarr and directory stores

Zarr/OME-Zarr are directory or object-store layouts rather than single regular
files. The local-file CLIs reject directories. Use a separately sandboxed,
version-aware Zarr workflow with explicit store and codec allowlists.

## Statistical EDA contract

1. Preserve the raw file and create a data dictionary with units and provenance.
2. Identify observational units, replicates, grouping, pairing, clustering,
   batches, sites, and time order before pooling.
3. Preserve missingness and censoring indicators. Do not automatically impute,
   substitute LOD/2, or treat non-detects as zero.
4. Compare classical and robust summaries. Outlier flags trigger measurement
   review and sensitivity analysis, not automatic deletion.
5. Record transformation formulas and scientific rationale; fit any learned
   parameter on training data only and retain raw-scale results.
6. Split subjects/groups/time before fitting imputers, scalers, feature
   selection, PCA, or other preprocessing.
7. Label post hoc patterns as exploratory. Define the hypothesis family and
   FWER/FDR plan before confirmatory testing.
8. Report effect sizes, uncertainty, assumptions, limitations, exact software
   versions, commands, deterministic rules/seeds, and derived artifact hashes.
9. Do not make causal claims from descriptive associations.

## Pinned optional snapshot

Verified from PyPI on 2026-07-23:

```bash
uv pip install \
  "numpy==2.5.1" \
  "pandas==3.0.5" \
  "polars==1.43.0" \
  "h5py==3.16.0"
```

NumPy 2.5.1 requires Python 3.12+. These are direct-package snapshots, not a
transitive lock; record a lockfile for a real analysis.
