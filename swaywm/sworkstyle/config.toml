# format:
#
#   "{pattern}" = { type = "generic" | "exact", value = "{icon}" }
#
# pattern: can either be the exact app_name or a piece of text contained in the title ignoring casing.
# icon: Your beatifull icon
#
# You can also you the shorthand for exact matching using
#   "{pattern}" = "{icon}"
#
# If it couldn't match something it will print:
#
# WARN [sworkstyle:config] No match for "{app_name}" with title "{title}"
#
# You can use {title} to do a generic matching
# You can use {app_name} to do a exact match
